# Polling-Unit-Outlier-Detection
# Outlier Detection Report of Zamfara State

# Explanation of the Methodology Used for Geospatial Analysis and Outlier Detection:

Outlier detection in geospatial analysis involves identifying points (in this case, polling units) that deviate significantly from other points in a dataset. The methodology typically includes:

Data Collection: Gathering data on polling units, including their geographic locations and party results.

Preprocessing: Cleaning the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and ensuring uniformity.

Geospatial Analysis: Mapping the polling units and analyzing spatial relationships and patterns.

Outlier Detection: Applying statistical or machine learning methods to identify outliers based on their outlier scores.

In this analysis, the outlier score represents how significantly a polling unit's results deviate from the expected patterns.

# 2. Summary of Findings:

The summary includes a sorted list of polling units by outlier scores for each party. Higher scores indicate greater deviation from the norm.

# 4. Conclusion

The analysis has identified polling units with significant deviations in their results for various parties. The top outliers suggest potential irregularities or unique voting behaviors that warrant further investigation.

Key insights:

- Outlier detection in geospatial data can highlight areas with potential irregularities.

- High outlier scores indicate significant deviations, which could be due to various factors like voter behavior, data entry errors, or electoral malpractices.

- Further investigation into the top outliers is recommended to understand the underlying reasons for these anomalies.

This polling unit showed significant deviation in its results for the Labour Party (LP).
